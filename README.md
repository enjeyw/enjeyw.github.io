Only slightly less lazy than "publishing" a Google Doc

This isn't really intended for public consumption right now, it's more of a set of my thoughts to myself for various experiments/explorations (mostly AI/ML related).

**Bonding Surface Price Functions** An old work that looks at creating information markets that can be shorted, by implementing a novel bonding curve/surface formulation. Not ML releated

**Minimal Chaos** What's interesting about chaos is that it results in very complex behaviours from very simple initial conditions, which I suspect may be useful for creating agent environments. This is my experimentation to learn more. What's the simplest to understand function that generates a chaotic output? 

**Aha Moments in LLMs** Curiosity may be at the root of general inteligence. Can we create a reward function curiosity/interesting things?

**Smart KV** A sudden realisation from working on the Aha Moments project that we can probably do smarter KV cache elimination based of small models trained on the keys themselves to predict token lifespan.
