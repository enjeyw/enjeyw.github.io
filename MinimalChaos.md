# Minimal Chaos

Recently I've been thinking a lot about emergent complexity and chaos. It's fansinating how seemingly very complex behaviour can arrive from a system with much simpler rules.

The thing about chaos is that it's very nature makes it somewhat difficult to intuit - you can't easily look at a chaotic system build a mental model of how it'll evolve. 

What exactly causes Chaotic behaviour? Like, why do some systems fall into very well defined periodic behaviour while others go flying away in an  unpredicable manner?

To better understand this, I've been looking into the simplest possible chaotic systems, to give me a better chance of peeking inside them to see what happens. There's also a certain poetry in seeing the chaos emerge from the most innocuous of rule sets.

Before I dive in, it's probably worth building a workable definition of Chaos. While there's no universally accepted definition, Wikipedia suggests the following three properties

1. it must be sensitive to initial conditions
2. it must be topologically transitive
3. it must have dense periodic orbits

The first requirement is the easiest to understand, and arguably the most important. It's capturing the pop-culture idea of the butterfly effect - that a tiny change in a system will set off a chain of events eventually compound into a huge difference further down the track.

This on its own is often given as the sole definition of chaos, but it's actually not enough, which is where the other two requirements come in. They get a little-mathy, and I think it's usefuly enough to simply show a system that is _not_ chaotic, but meets the first requirement:

Imagine I had a ball on an infinitely flat surface, and I give it a nudge, perhaps in a due North direction. After a very long time, the ball will be 1000s of kilometers away in the northerly direction.

Now imagine instead of nudging that ball in a perfectly due North direction, I instead nudged it ever so slightly off due North, say 0.0000001 degrees. After 1000s of kilometers the ball will end in a completely different location. So here we have sensitivity to initial conditions, but the behavior is pretty clearly not chaotic.
